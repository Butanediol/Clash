## Why

1. I believe proxy experience should be as transparent as possible, a clunky GUI really doesn't feel like so.
2. Most GUI clients tend to mess up my config file, they don't fully respect my clash config.
3. Most GUI clients install a service to avoid UAC prompts, convenient but I really don't like having another third-party service running background.
4. Most GUI clients are ugly (sorry). They don't respect platform native design language.
5. The old [ClashXW](https://github.com/ysc3839/ClashXW) is great, big shoutout to the original author, but it doesn't have a TUN toggle button. (And if you don't need a convenient TUN toggle button, it might be better to just use the original ClashXW)

## This is not for you if

1. You don't know what Clash is.
2. You don't know how to use Clash **core**.
3. You want a fancy GUI client.
4. You want minimal performance overhead, I am a shit coder, and this is a .NET WPF app after all.

## How to use

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Butanediol/Clash/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a folder of your choice.
3. Run the `ClashXW.exe` file.
4. Edit the configuration file under `%APPDATA%\ClashXW\config`. You can have multiple config files there.
5. Reload the application to apply the changes.

## Bonus

- If you want to use TUN mode, you need to run the program with Administrator privileges.
- You don't need to wait for this application to update if you want to use a newer version of clash. You can simply replace the `clash.exe` file in the installation directory with the newer version. Or open the dashboard, go to Settings and click **Upgrade Clash Core**.
